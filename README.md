# ğŸš§ Secret Patterns ğŸš§ 

The goal of this repository is to catalogue known secret patterns.

## Current Status

We started a [generic pattern format research project](https://github.com/secret-scanning-sig/research/tree/research-generic-pattern-format/generic-pattern-format).
Once we have a defined format and a few translators, we will start porting patterns to this repo.
