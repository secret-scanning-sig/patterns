# ðŸš§ Secret Scanning Rules ðŸš§ 

The goal of this repository is to catalogue known secret patterns.

## Current Status

We recently completed a [generic pattern format research project](https://github.com/secret-scanning-sig/research/tree/research-generic-pattern-format/generic-pattern-format).
We're now in the process of setting up this repo with that format.
